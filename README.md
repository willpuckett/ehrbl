> a tiny board to celebrate the coming of 🍂 with minimal finger travel.

![populated board prototype](.images/prototype_populated.png)

After spending the day at my computer, I stepped out with friends Saturday night
for a burger & beverage. On the patio of our local institution, the air was
cool.

> _Autumn had undeniably arrived._

I had been wanting to squeeze a Ferris Sweep out of a Xiao somehow and it
occurred to me as I later continued working that maybe I was actually trying to
make a 28 key keyboard. I reached for a leaf to lay over the keys: the maple fit
nicely, conjuring memories of _beurre d'érable_ (maple butter) in Montreal's
Jean-Talon Market.

## Putting it Together

[![KiBot](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/actions/workflows/kibot.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/actions/workflows/kibot.yml)

### Fabrication & Assembly Files [[zip](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/releases/latest/download/jlcpcb.zip)]

JLC likes to install the 3305's upside down. Include
[this pic](.images/3305-installation.png) along with a note requesting they be
installed thru-hole.

Choose 28 keys, or 26 keys with encoders.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use **3.7v LIR1254** (lithium ion rechargable) battery **only**, being sure to
> not install it upside down.

## Case

[![Build123d Case](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/actions/workflows/case.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/actions/workflows/case.yml)

### There's a case [[step](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/releases/latest/download/case.step)] [[stl](https://github.com/willpuckett/ehrbl/releases/latest/download/case.step)]

It's really more of a skin. Print and place the pcb directly in it. The case is
only one half, flip it in your slicer for the other half 🙃

> [!TIP]
> Polymaker TPU works well. It seems to like to print slow and cool—leave the
> door ajar.

TPU is relatively non-slip, and it absorbs and distributes the force of
typing—no bumpons necessary.

Using a variant that should probably be referred to as _Befuddle_, scoring a
whispy 636.1 "total word effort" on
[cyanophage](https://cyanophage.github.io/playground.html?layout=bfdl%2F%3Bpouyjcstrx-naihqvwgm%5C%3Dk%2C.%27ze&mode=ergo&lan=english);
it's buttery-er than any other (posted) layout. The Y-punctuation cluster interaction is it's greatest shortcoming, but it seems to be the least of all evils.

Highly optimized for right handed CAD—Blender, KiCad, Shapr...
